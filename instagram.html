Launched in 2010, it has become one of the most popular platforms worldwide, with over 2 billion users. The app focuses on visual content, offering features like the main feed for posts, Stories that disappear after 24 hours, Reels for short-form vertical videos, and the Explore page to discover trending content. Users can also send private messages, go live, and even shop directly through the app. Instagram is widely used by individuals, influencers, and businesses for personal expression, entertainment, networking, and marketing.</h2>
